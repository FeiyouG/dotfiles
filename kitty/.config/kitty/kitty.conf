#: Color scheme {{{

# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors

# background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this setting when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this setting by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. Makes
#: it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the current
#: background color for each window. This setting applies only if
#: background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported or
#: background_image is set.

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.

#: }}}

#: Advanced {{{

# shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files.

editor 'nvim'

#: The terminal editor (such as ``vim`` or ``nano``) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell (``$SHELL -l -i -c env``) to see if your
#: shell config files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (``vim``, ``emacs``,
#: etc) and take the first one that exists on your system.

# close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the
#: default), the terminal will remain open when the child exits as
#: long as there are still processes outputting to the terminal (for
#: example disowned or backgrounded processes). If yes, the window
#: will close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it
#: to yes means that any background processes still using the terminal
#: can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc.  Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections. You can chose to either allow any program running
#: within kitty to control it, with yes or only programs that connect
#: to the socket specified with the kitty --listen-on command line
#: option, if you use the value socket-only. The latter is useful if
#: you want to prevent programs running on a remote computer over ssh
#: from controlling kitty. Reloading the config will not affect this
#: setting.

# listen_on none

#: Tell kitty to listen to the specified unix/tcp socket for remote
#: control connections. Note that this will apply to all kitty
#: instances. It can be overridden by the kitty --listen-on command
#: line flag. This option accepts only UNIX sockets, such as
#: unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or (on Linux) unix:@mykitty. Environment
#: variables are expanded. If {kitty_pid} is present then it is
#: replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the PID of the
#: kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen. This option
#: is ignored unless you also set allow_remote_control to enable
#: remote control. See the help for kitty --listen-on for more
#: details. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# env

#: Specify environment variables to set in all child processes. Note
#: that environment variables are expanded recursively, so if you
#: use::

#:     env MYVAR1=a
#:     env MYVAR2=${MYVAR1}/${HOME}/b

#: The value of MYVAR2 will be a/<path to home directory>/b. Using
#: VAR= will set it to the empty string and using just VAR will delete
#: the variable from the child process' environment.

# watcher

#: Path to python file which will be loaded for
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/#watchers. Can be specified
#: more than once to load multiple watchers. The watchers will be
#: added to every kitty window. Relative paths are resolved relative
#: to the kitty config directory. Note that reloading the config will
#: only affect windows created after the reload.

# exe_search_path

#: Control where kitty looks to find programs to run. The default
#: search order is: First search the system wide PATH, then
#: ~/.local/bin and ~/bin. If not still not found, the PATH defined in
#: the login shell after sourcing all its startup files is tried.
#: Finally, if present, the PATH in the env option is tried.

#: This option allows you to prepend, append, or remove paths from
#: this search order. It can be specified multiple times for multiple
#: paths. A simple path will be prepended to the search order. A path
#: that starts with the + sign will be append to the search order,
#: after ~/bin above. A path that starts with the - sign will be
#: removed from the entire search order. For example::

#:     exe_search_path /some/prepended/path
#:     exe_search_path +/some/appended/path
#:     exe_search_path -/some/excluded/path

# update_check_interval 24

#: Periodically check if an update to kitty is available. If an update
#: is found a system notification is displayed informing you of the
#: available update. The default is to check every 24 hrs, set to zero
#: to disable. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#startup-sessions in the
#: kitty documentation for details. Note that relative paths are
#: interpreted with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment
#: variables in the path are expanded. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
#: primary read-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even one running on a remote
#: server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 64

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_control. A value of zero means no size limit is applied.

# file_transfer_confirmation_bypass

#: A password, that can be supplied to the file transfer kitten to
#: skip the transfer confirmation prompt. This should only be used
#: when initiating transfers from trusted computers, over trusted
#: networks or encrypted transports, as it allows programs running on
#: the remote machine to read/write to the local filesystem, without
#: permission.

# allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink (OSC 8) escape sequences. If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click by with the mouse or the hints kitten
#: </kittens/hints>. The special value of ``ask`` means that kitty
#: will ask before opening the link when clicked.

# shell_integration enabled

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells.  Set to
#: ``disabled`` to turn off shell integration, completely. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/ for details.

# term xterm-kitty
# term xterm-256color

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

# wayland_titlebar_color system

#: Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on Wayland systems
#: with client side window decorations such as GNOME. A value of
#: system means to use the default system color, a value of background
#: means to use the background color of the currently active window
#: and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

# macos_titlebar_color system

#: Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value
#: of system means to use the default system color, light or dark can
#: also be used to set it explicitly. A value of background means to
#: use the background color of the currently active window and finally
#: you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red. WARNING:
#: This option works by using a hack, as there is no proper Cocoa API
#: for it. It sets the background color of the entire window and makes
#: the titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with
#: background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are probably
#: better off just hiding the titlebar with hide_window_decorations.

macos_option_as_alt both

#: Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will
#: use the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This
#: will break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal
#: programs, but you can use the macOS unicode input technique. You
#: can use the values: left, right, or both to use only the left,
#: right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Changing this setting by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks (⌘+Tab) on macOS. Changing
#: this setting by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed. By
#: default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as is
#: the expected behavior on macOS.

# macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level (OS) windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS. Changing this setting by reloading the config
#: will only affect newly created windows.

# macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes. For example, a value of
#: 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-pixel
#: antialiasing at common font sizes.

# macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the traditional full-screen transition, that is faster, but
#: less pretty.

# macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Show or hide the window title in the macOS window or menu-bar. A
#: value of window will show the title of the currently active window
#: at the top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the
#: title of the currently active window in the macOS menu-bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. all will show the title everywhere
#: and none hides the title in the window and the menu-bar. See
#: :opt`macos_menubar_title_max_length` for how to control the length
#: of the title in the menu bar.

# macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of characters from the window title to show in
#: the global menubar. Values less than one mean there is no maximum.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Enable/disable custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see
#: on both light and dark backgrounds. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this setting
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

# linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this setting by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase unicode characters.
#: For example: ``a`` for the A key, ``[`` for the left square bracket
#: key, etc. For functional keys, such as ``Enter or Escape`` the
#: names are present at https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-
#: protocol/#functional-key-definitions. For modifier keys, the names
#: are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt (opt, option, ⌥), super (cmd,
#: command, ⌘). See also: GLFW mods
#: <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-input option.
#: Then kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that
#: text look for ``native_code`` the value of that becomes the key
#: name in the shortcut. For example:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     on_key_input: glfw key: 65 native_code: 0x61 action: PRESS mods: 0x0 text: 'a'

#: Here, the key name for the A key is 0x61 and you can use it with::

#:     map ctrl+0x61 something

#: to map ctrl+a to something.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

#: If you would like kitty to completely ignore a key event, not even
#: sending it to the program running in the terminal, map it to
#: discard_event::

#:     map kitty_mod+f1 discard_event

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: this will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here </actions>.

# kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: The value of kitty_mod is used as the modifier for all default
#: shortcuts, you can change it in your kitty.conf to change the
#: modifiers for all the default shortcuts.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: You can have kitty remove all shortcut definition seen up to this
#: point. Useful, for instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# action_alias

#: E.g. action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

#: Define aliases to avoid repeating the same options in multiple
#: mappings. Aliases can be defined for any action. Aliases are
#: expanded recursively. For example, the above alias allows you to
#: create mappings to launch a new tab in the current working
#: directory without duplication::

#:     map f1 launch_tab vim
#:     map f2 launch_tab emacs

#: Similarly, to alias kitten invocation::

#:     action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

# kitten_alias

#: E.g. kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: Like action_alias above but, specifically for kittens. Generally,
#: prefer to use action_alias. This option is a legacy version,
#: present for backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of
#: the aliased kitten to be substituted. So the example above will
#: cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the --hints-
#: offset=0 option applied.

#: Clipboard {{{

#: Copy to clipboard

# map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard

#::  There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#::  mapped to Ctrl+c. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#::  send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly,
#::  copy_and_clear_or_interrupt will copy and clear the selection or

#: Paste from clipboard

# map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard

#: Paste from selection

# map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
# map shift+insert paste_from_selection

#: Pass selection to program

# map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#: Select and act on visible text {{{

#: Use the hints kitten to select text and either pass it to an
#: external program or insert it into the terminal or copy it to the
#: clipboard.

#: Open URL

# map kitty_mod+e open_url_with_hints

#::  Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used
#::  to open the URL is specified in open_url_with.

#: Insert selected path

# map kitty_mod+p>f kitten hints --type path --program -

#::  Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful,
#::  for instance to run git commands on a filename output from a
#::  previous git command.

#: Open selected path

# map kitty_mod+p>shift+f kitten hints --type path

#::  Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

#: Insert selected line

# map kitty_mod+p>l kitten hints --type line --program -

#::  Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Use for
#::  the output of things like: ls -1

#: Insert selected word

# map kitty_mod+p>w kitten hints --type word --program -

#::  Select words and insert into terminal.

#: Insert selected hash

# map kitty_mod+p>h kitten hints --type hash --program -

#::  Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the
#::  terminal. Useful with git, which uses sha1 hashes to identify
#::  commits

#: Open the selected file at the selected line

# map kitty_mod+p>n kitten hints --type linenum

#::  Select something that looks like filename:linenum and open it in
#::  vim at the specified line number.

#: Open the selected hyperlink

# map kitty_mod+p>y kitten hints --type hyperlink

#::  Select a hyperlink (i.e. a URL that has been marked as such by
#::  the terminal program, for example, by ls --hyperlink=auto).


#: The hints kitten has many more modes of operation that you can map
#: to different shortcuts. For a full description see kittens/hints.

#: Reset the terminal

# map kitty_mod+delete clear_terminal reset active
# map opt+cmd+r        clear_terminal reset active

#::  You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For
#::  example::

#::      # Reset the terminal
#::      map kitty_mod+f9 clear_terminal reset active
#::      # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
#::      map kitty_mod+f10 clear_terminal clear active
#::      # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
#::      map kitty_mod+f11 clear_terminal scrollback active
#::      # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#::      map kitty_mod+f12 clear_terminal scroll active

#::  If you want to operate on all windows instead of just the current
#::  one, use all instead of active.

#::  It is also possible to remap Ctrl+L to both scroll the current
#::  screen contents into the scrollback buffer and clear the screen,
#::  instead of just clearing the screen, for example, for ZSH add the
#::  following to ~/.zshrc:

#::  .. code-block:: sh

#::      scroll-and-clear-screen() {
#::          printf '\n%.0s' {1..$LINES}
#::          zle clear-screen
#::      }
#::      zle -N scroll-and-clear-screen
#::      bindkey '^l' scroll-and-clear-screen

#: Clear up to cursor line

# map cmd+k clear_terminal to_cursor active

#: Reload kitty.conf

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file
# map ctrl+cmd+,   load_config_file

#::  Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it
#::  was loaded. Note that a handful of settings cannot be dynamically
#::  changed and require a full restart of kitty.  You can also map a
#::  keybinding to load a different config file, for example::

#::      map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#::  Note that all setting from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#::  in other words the new conf settings *replace* the old ones.

#: Debug kitty configuration

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config
# map opt+cmd+,    debug_config

#::  Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running
#::  with and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.

#: Send arbitrary text on key presses

#::  E.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all Hello World

#::  You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#::  client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For
#::  example::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#::  This will send "Special text" when you press the ctrl+alt+a key
#::  combination.  The text to be sent is a python string literal so
#::  you can use escapes like \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to
#::  send unicode characters (or you can just input the unicode
#::  characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument to
#::  send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the
#::  shortcut. The possible values are normal or application or kitty
#::  or a comma separated combination of them.  The special keyword
#::  all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
#::  the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the
#::  special kitty extended keyboard protocol.

#::  Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor to
#::  the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key)::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
